This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

| Rule                         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All code lives in `src/`** | Keeps repo root clean.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Assets**                   | Every font, icon and image is stored under `assets/`.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Components**               | _Common_ UI (e.g. `Text`, `TextInput`) in the root of `components/`. Components used only in a specific flow (e.g. `CurrencyButton`) go into a dedicated sub-folder (`components/Currency/`). |
| **Static data**              | Constant lists such as currencies in `constData/`.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Enums**                    | Single source of truth for screen / stack names.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Navigation**               | Root navigator + any Bottom-Tab / Drawer / Stack navigators and their type defs.                                                                                                              |
| **Network**                  | `axios.ts` for configuration, `requests/` for one-file-per-endpoint functions.                                                                                                                |
| **Provider**                 | Centralised colors, fonts, spacing ‚Äî makes themable UI easy.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Screens**                  | Each screen is a React component; large feature flows get their own sub-directory.                                                                                                            |
| **Store**                    | MobX for state management. `CurrencyStore` owns API calls, data shaping and error handling.                                                                                                   |
| **Types**                    | All shared TypeScript types, including navigation params.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Utils**                    | Helper functions (e.g. `resizeHelper`) that ensure consistent layout on every device.                                                                                                         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è State Management (MobX)

- One store per flow; currently **`CurrencyStore`**  
  ‚Äì calls request functions from `network/requests`  
  ‚Äì transforms / caches data  
  ‚Äì exposes observable state to UI
- Components consume stores via `useRootStore()` and are wrapped with `observer`.

---

## üåê Networking Layer

| File/Folder         | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `network/axios.ts`  | Creates an Axios instance, sets base URL, timeouts, interceptors. |
| `network/requests/` | Pure, one-endpoint = one-file functions returning typed promises. |

---

## üöÄ Performance Optimisations

- **Debounced API calls**  
  `lodash.debounce` waits **200 ms** after user stops typing in `AmountInput` before fetching rates ‚Üí prevents a flood of requests.

- **`React.memo` on list rows**  
  `CurrencyListItem` re-renders only if its own props change, not when another list item updates.

- **Adaptive Sizing**  
  `utils/resizeHelper` converts design pixels to device units, keeping the layout visually identical across screen sizes and resolutions.

---

## üé® Theme & Style Tokens

All colour palettes and font families live in `provider/`.  
Switching to dark mode or adding a new font requires changes in exactly one place.

---

## üß≠ Navigation

- Root navigator exported from `navigation/index.tsx`.
- Additional groups (Bottom Tab, Drawer, etc.) get their own files in `navigation/`.
- Enum names come from `enum/SCREENS.ts`; navigation types are in `types/NavigationTypes.ts`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Project

1. **New flow** ‚Üí add a sub-folder in `screens/`, create matching store & components sub-folder.
2. **New endpoint** ‚Üí add a file under `network/requests/` and a method in the relevant store.
3. **New screen** ‚Üí add to `enum/SCREENS.ts`, import it in the appropriate navigator.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start

```bash
yarn install         # or npm ci
yarn start           # run on simulator / device
```
